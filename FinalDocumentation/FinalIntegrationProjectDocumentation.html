    <h2>Narrative Description</h2>
    <p>"Animal Sound Match" is an interactive game designed to test players' reflexes and auditory recognition skills. With just 20 seconds on the clock, players must press the corresponding button (cow or dog) at the exact moment the image appears to score points. The game features flashing images of cows and dogs accompanied by their respective sounds. A correct match earns the player a point and illuminates a green LED on the Arduino board, while a wrong match deducts a point and activates a red LED.</p>
