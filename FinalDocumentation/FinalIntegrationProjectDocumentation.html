    <h2>Narrative Description</h2>
    <p>"Animal Sound Match" is an interactive game designed to test players' reflexes and auditory recognition skills. With just 20 seconds on the clock, players must press the corresponding button (cow or dog) at the exact moment the image appears to score points. The game features flashing images of cows and dogs accompanied by their respective sounds. A correct match earns the player a point and illuminates a green LED on the Arduino board, while a wrong match deducts a point and activates a red LED.</p>

    <h3>Hardware Input</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino Setup: Two buttons are linked to Arduino pins. The Arduino code is programmed to detect button presses and communicate with the p5.js code. When a button is pressed, it triggers the corresponding cow or dog sound to play.</li>
        <li><img src="images/button.png" alt="Arduino Button"></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hardware Output</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Green LED Output: The green LED will flash if the player hits the correct button at the correct time.</li>
        <li>Red LED Output: The red LED will flash if the player hits the incorrect button.</li>
